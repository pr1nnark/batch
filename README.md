# batch
Simple batch script to wipe selected userdata from Win and Chrome, without removing extensions etc

bootup.bat is the plain batch script, but there's also a powershell version for a deeper chrome clean. To attach, simply uncomment in the .bat file, customise the .ps1 file to your liking and save.
